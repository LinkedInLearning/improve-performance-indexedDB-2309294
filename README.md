As developers strive to create web applications that work efficiently and can tolerate unreliable network connections, caching and local storage approaches become increasingly critical. In many cases, leveraging the IndexedDB API and key caching strategies can offer huge software performance boosts. In this course, instructor Mike Oram delves into what caching and the IndexedDB API are, as well as how to work with them to boost your application's performance. Learn about the pros and cons of different caching strategies, how to implement caching in your application, and how to assess the subsequent performance gains. Plus, review techniques for storing, retrieving, and updating data with IndexedDB, including different strategies for storing dynamic data on the client side.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `master` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
